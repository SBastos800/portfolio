            <p>Hello! I'm Sonia. I'm naturally inquisitive, and in my professional life I'm dedicated and have always pursued my dreams. I was born in Portugal, and I grew up near Porto, which is where I went to the University. After I graduated as a nurse, I spent four and a half years working in a National Hospital in Lisbon. I loved living in Lisbon, but eventually, drawn by the English language and career opportunities, I decided to move to London to take a role as a Staff Nurse in one of the most renowned Private Hospitals in London. I fully settled in London, and after a further 8 years working in the healthcare sector, I've leapt into the world of Tech and am now an aspiring Trainee Web Developer. I'm passionate about new experiences and when experiencing feeling of the unknown, my curiosity gives me courage to keep going!</p>

            <p>There's something fascinating about learning languages! The capacity of being able to comunicate with others and switch as if we had a button in our memory that selects the chosen language! Speaking english as second language gives me exactly that experience, however the eagerness to repeat this experience drown me into starting learn French. I've been learning French throught the app Duolingo which also has been recently teaching me more  about technology. I also love to cycle, travelling, going to bars and restaurants in London and experience new places. If staying in, I like to watch netflix including documentaries.   </p>
